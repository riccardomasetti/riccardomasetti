# Hey there, I'm Riccardo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Computer Science and Engineering student** at **Politecnico di Milano**, always eager to dive into new challenges.

My curiosity primarily leads me to:
* **AI and its real-world applications:** Thinking about how intelligent systems can solve everyday problems.
* **Optimizing Algorithms:** Because efficiency matters!
* **Cybersecurity:** Protecting digital landscapes is key.

Beyond that, I've built up practical experience through various **web development** projects.

Take a look around my repos, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have a cool idea or just want to chat about tech!
